For each statement, indicate if it is True or False by circling T or F.
If you need to cross out an answer, be sure that your final answer is
clear and unambigous---otherwise it will receive no credit.

Assume there is a class called \textbf{Student} that has private member variables
\texttt{string name, int perm}. Assume that Student has getters and setters for each of
these data members \texttt{getName}, \texttt{setName}, \texttt{getPerm} and \texttt{setPerm}, and a
constructor that takes \texttt{name} and \texttt{perm} as parameters.  Assume that the class
is declare in file \texttt{student.h} . In other words, you are given the following
class definition:

\begin{verbatim}
class Student {
  std::string name;
  int perm;
public:
  Student(std::string name, int perm) :
    name(name), perm(perm) {}

  const std::string & getName() const {
    return name;
  }

  void setName(std::string name) {
    this->name = name;
  }

  int getPerm() const {
    return perm;
  }

  void setPerm(int perm) {
    this->perm = perm;
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\begin{enumerate}
\item (8 pts) Write the contents of a .h file for a derived a class called
\textbf{CmpscStudent} that inherits from \textbf{Student} and has additional data members
including \texttt{*string* ugradDegreeType, *bool* graduateStudent}.  Include
prototypes for a public constructor that initializes all of the data members
of \textbf{CmpscStudent} as well as getters (but not setters) for the additional
data members of CmpscStudent. Do not implement these constructors and methods
as inline. Just give the prototypes in the class definition.

\begin{description}
  \item[Answer:] .\\
  \begin{verbatim}
    class CmpscStudent: public Student {
      std::string ugradDegreeType;
      bool graduateStudent;
    public:
       CmpscStudent(
          string name,
          int perm,
          string ugradDegreeType,
          bool graduateStudent
       );
       string getUgradDegreeType();
       bool isGraduateStudent();
    };
    \end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\newpage

\item (8 pts) Write the function definition for the constructor
\textbf{CmpscStudent} that takes as its parameters all of the data members
of CmpscStudent, and fully initializes the object being constructed,
as it would appears in the .cpp file.

\begin{description}
  \item[Answer:] .\\
  \begin{verbatim}
       CmpscStudent::CmpscStudent(
          string name,
          int perm,
          string ugradDegreeType,
          bool graduateStudent
       ) : Student(name, perm) {
         this->ugradDegreeType = ugradDegreeType;
         this->graduateStudent = graduateStudent;
       }
    \end{verbatim}
\end{description}

\end{enumerate}
